# 🌇 City Manager App 🌇

### ❓ About the App:
> In cities, there is such a problem as breakdowns, holes on the roads, trees felled by the wind, and utilities often notice this too late. So why not create an application that will allow you to send issues directly to the municipality, so that the problem is immediately seen and solved?

##### Our app is a good option!
 
### 🧠 Main idea:
> The idea is that every resident of the city can create issues for those things that bother him ( example: a hole in the road). After the issue is created, you can track the status of its execution, communicate with the person who makes it
You can also use the map to look at which things in general in the city write these issues

### 📱 Requirements

There are no requirements yet, so **stay tuned for updates!**

### Here's a 👉🏻 [Github](https://github.com/CityManagerApp) link of our project
* Please, pay attention to that fact that the app now is in Russian, because all developers are native Russian speakers, but after the app is done at least demo, English language will be added 

Also we have User Flow Diagram. Please, check it out [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l1wU3os=/)


### 🖍 UX/UI design

Now we have pretty good design made in [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0LUYQGhrCj6adIUaZUQv1T/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1). In the near future it will be the design of app.
